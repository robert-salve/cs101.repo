# The results it displayed whats inside the data frame which are empty, 0 obs. of
# 5 variables. Instead of displaying <0 rows> (or 0-length row.names) it displayed:
# 'data.frame':	0 obs. of  5 variables:
# $ Ints      : int 
# $ Doubles   : num 
# $ Characters: chr 
# $ Logicals  : logi 
# $ Factors   : Factor w/ 0 levels: 
#  NULL
# Due to print(str(df)) it displayed the varibles of the dataset in vertical with the 
# following functions.

# The title of the bar graph is sentiments of tweets per day. It has a legend at the right
# side, red for negative, yellow for neutral, and blue for positive. In day 1
# July 14, 2020 the negative sentiments almost reach 2,500. In day 2 July 15, 2020 the 
# negative sentiments sky rocketed to 4,000 plus. While in day 3 and 4 negative sentiments 
# went down around 3,000 plus. Then day 5 it went down again to 2,000 plus then went up at 
# day 6. The graph is mostly negative sentiments from day 1 to 6.
